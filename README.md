    "this is ASL hand sign classification project.this model is capable of predicting first 9 signs also detecting uncategorized signs or pictures\n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "this model can handle both regular and hard test set in separate files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "All the computations were done on Hipergator Tensorflow-2.7.0 kernel\n",

    "\n",
    "All the computations were done on Hipergator Tensorflow-2.7.0 kernel\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "This project comes with 4 different codes:\n",
    "1. Data prepration:          xceptionDataPrep.ipynb\n",
    "2. Training the data:        xceptiontrain.ipynb\n",
    "3. Making prediction:        xceptionPredict.ipynb\n",
    "4. Hard test set prediction: xceptionPredictHard.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "[you can find the codes here](https://github.com/UF-FundMachineLearning-Fall23/final-project-code-report-thebestteam/tree/main)\n",
    "The first two codes are for your review and for making prediction the second two would be enough.( they have built-in data handling capabilities)\n",
    "In order to make prediction in either regular and hard test set you need to:\n",
    "1. load your data and label file in the begining of the code:\n",
    "![like this](load.png)\n",
    "2. make sure the \"best_weights7.h5\" is in your current work directory\n",
    "3. run the cells one by one \n",
