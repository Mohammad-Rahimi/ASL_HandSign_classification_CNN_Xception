The objective of this project was to classify American Sign Language (ASL) characters. A transfer learning approach with convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to train the model on a total of 8443 pictures of nine different hand signs. The model performed in training and validation sets with 99.9% and 100% accuracy respectively. The model is capable of handling mislabeled and uncategorized data as well. This capability was achieved through defining a threshold function to deal with uncertainty in the data. All in all with a combination of data preprocessing and fine tuning the parameters of the problem the aforementioned accuracies was attained proving the robustness of the CNN approach.
